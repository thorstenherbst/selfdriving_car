# Self driving car simulation migrated to Angular 18 (WIP) 

This is Angular 18 Application with Nx 19. I created due to my willing of understanding how AI works and 
how goals of creating self driving cars are achieved. This repo does not claim to be complete. 
It is just intended to show that such things can also be implemented with Angular and a domain driven design. 


## Integration of Nx

## Creating a Remote

In the concept of Module Federation a remote is the term given to an application that exposes modules that can be shared to and consumed by host applications.
This is the key difference between a remote and host.

A remote exposes modules that can be consumed
A host consumes exposed modules
Nx includes first-class support for helping you to scaffold a Module Federation Architecture for your React and Angular application(s).

Generating a Remote

To generate a remote application in your workspace, run the following command:

```
nx g @nx/angular:remote myremote --directory=apps/angular/myremote
```
To use the new remote you have to add it to your routing module in the shell application.

```
 {
    path: '<appname>',
    loadChildren: () => import('<appname>/Routes').then((m) => m.remoteRoutes),
  },
```

## Converting an existing app to a remote application

Even though you can add a remote application, you can also convert an existing application to a 
remote and attach to the host.

The setup-mf generator is used to add Module Federation support to existing applications.
To convert an existing application to a remote application and attach it to an existing host application name myhostapp, run the following
```
nx g setup-mf myapp --mfType=remote --routing=true --host=myhostapp
```
More information on that you can find here: ✨ **[Create Module Federation configuration files for given Angular Application.](https://nx.dev/nx-api/angular/generators/setup-mf)** ✨


## Start the application

Run `npx nx serve frontend` or `npm run start:frontend`  to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build frontend` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
